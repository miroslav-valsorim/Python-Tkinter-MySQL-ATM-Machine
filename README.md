# Python-Tkinter-MySQL-ATM-Machine
It's a simple project where I have tried to replicate the work of an ATM machine, with the normal ATM functions like Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance etc.
I have connected it with MySQL Database, and used few sql queries, there is also unit testing with some explaination in the unit testing files.

1.In folder MySQL_connection_and_creation there is example how you can connect and log into MySQL
2.Once you open the project you have to run it from Main as it is on the screenshot
